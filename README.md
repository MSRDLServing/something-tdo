Something t'do
=============

A project I did for the Mobile Development course. 

A location-based event calendar for Android. 

Something tâ€™do is a relevant and customizable calendar of events. A
calendar of events is a chronological list of events ranging from
concerts and sports to galleries and festivals. All events include a date,
location, category and description.
